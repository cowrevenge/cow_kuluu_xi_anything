/* f_10067e50 - the whole original is `mov eax, ecx / ret`: it hands back the object it was called on (thiscall: ecx is the object)

   The body is shared (src/util/cow_return.c) because a lot of entries compile to exactly this; what is
   per-entry is the adapter below, and what makes it done is cowdiff against this entry's generated
   original plus tools/cow/gate.ps1 - which refuses a trivial body unless the ledger can say who calls it.
