/* layout/addresses.h - the only file in the repository where a guest address is written down.

   Every constant here names something the code actually uses, with the evidence that ties the number
   to the meaning. Nothing in src/ may contain a 0x10xxxxxx literal: if user code needs an address,
   it gets a name from this file (and the name goes into cow/names.csv).

   Image-internal addresses (anything inside .rdata/.data, which the retail launcher may relocate) are
   used through COW_VIEW/COW_GLOBAL in cow.h, which add the relocation delta. Handles read out of
   guest memory are not constants and are never listed here.
